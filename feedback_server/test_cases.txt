I have not included any actual integration tests but here is a description of some of the functional testing I did using a REST client.

* Feedback for new session from a new user - 200.
* Feedback from a user who has already left feedback for the session - 409.
* Feedback request missing the X-UserId header - 400.
* Insert over 15 feedbacks, use GET /v1/feedback and see that only 15 are returned and they are in timestamp descending order.
- All feedback data matches what was inserted.
- Pay specific attention that the timestamp is successfully converted back from epoch seconds in DB to UTC format.
* Insert feedbacks for varying rating.
- Use the rating parameter on GET /v1/feedback results in only feedbacks of that rating to be returned.
- Exclude the rating parameter on GET /v1/feedback and see that the results in feedbacks of varying rating.
