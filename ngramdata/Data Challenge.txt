Let's say you have this data set. This is a bi-gram data set showing occurrences of particular bi-grams from some text corpus. Here you see bi-grams that start with the word ‘awesome’: awesome food, awesome picture and awesome game.

The program that takes this input
<starting word> <max number of words>

From the above example, the starting word will be “awesome”. The program needs to look up all bi-grams that start with “awesome”. We have three in the above data set. Then, it needs to select one of them with the highest probability across all the years.

Given the probability weights, the program might pick "food". That now becomes the starting bi-gram word. Now, it needs to evaluate all bi-grams that start with "food" and select the next word and so on.

Program repeats the process until either there are no bi-grams left that starts with the last selected word or we got the max number of words.

Write out an algorithm or pseudo code to implement this program.
