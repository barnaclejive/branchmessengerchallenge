Design Challenge

Design a role based access control system for the following matrix:

Feature Employee  Manager Supervisor  District Leader Regional Leader Corporate Leader
A       x	        x			  x           x               x               x
B       x         x       x           x               x               x
C                 x       x           x               x               x
D                                     x               x               x
E                                     x                               x
F                                                                     x


Feel free to code it using any language and/or the required database design. Pseudo code with detailed design would also work.
The system should be extensible to add more roles and more features.
